I recommend you install the development environment and play with the source code yourself; make improvements and submit PRs to help your fellow players. See [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/paulbilnoski/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

However, if you're only interested in installing and running the tool, head on to the [releases](https://github.com/paulbilnoski/StarTrekTimelinesSpreadsheet/releases) page and pick a recent release to install.
