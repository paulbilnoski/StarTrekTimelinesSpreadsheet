# How to contribute

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this tool on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Testing

Validating the features of the tool with a wide variety of user profiles (with or without frozen crew, in a fleet or not, with or without profile picture, at various levels, etc.), and reporting back the results is always welcome.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).

Particularly looking for folks with frontend (HTML / CSS) experience.

*Note:* I will not approve pull requests that automate any part of the game play. Not only would that be a violation of the game's terms of service, it would also enable cheating which I don't condone. Firstly, I'm a player of Star Trek Timelines and want to enjoy the game as its authors intended for it to be enjoyed.

## Statistics and algorithms

Features such as crew recommendations could definitely use the input of a more statistics-oriented person. Even if you're not a coder, suggesting ways to analyze the crew data and provide meaningful recommendations (even in plain english) would be a huge help.
